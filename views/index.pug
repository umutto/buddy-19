                    | This just a fun project that I've started doing to practice my node backend and play with socket.io during the self-quarantine. It is hastily made, and just a side project that I don't intend to make money or anything. So do what you want with it, but bear in mind I'm currently the sole developer and hosting it with my own funds, so I opted out for the cheap and quick ways, anything and everything can broke.
